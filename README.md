Like other departments within the Government of Canada, the Strategic Research and Statistics Department of Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada lacks a strategic approach for documenting, finding and using data that is required to meet the increasing demand for quality and timely data. Furthermore, issues resulting from siloed data systems and inadequate documentation make it difficult to use datasets to their full potential which affects research and the use of statistics.

This report introduces a dataset tracking system and assessment methodology framework, discusses strategies for searching for data, identifies sources of data and presents the main results of a statistical analysis run using selected datasets. It also examines common problems with datasets available to the department, such as those in the Open Government Data Portal.

The report concludes with a discussion on the adequacy of the templates and systems for data documenting, and describes challenges that still remain. The code (SAS and SQL) for the regression analysis is included in the appendices.
